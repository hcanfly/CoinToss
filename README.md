CoinToss
=============

CoinToss is an iOS app written in Swift that simulates a coin being tossed. Now there is no need to carry spare change just so that you can flip a coin to see who pays for lunch :-)

Instructions
------------

You will need the Xcode 6 Developer Preview to build and run the project. Because of the universal storyboard it will probably only run on iOS 8.
